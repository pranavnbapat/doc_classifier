# Document Subcategories Consolidation Plan

## Overview

**Objective:** 
1. Remove "Slideshow/Presentation" as a separate category
2. Migrate its subcategories into "Document"
3. Consolidate/merge redundant Document subcategories

**Current State:**
- Document: 23 subcategories
- Slideshow/Presentation: 6 subcategories (2 already shared with Document)
- **After merge (before consolidation): 27 unique subcategories**

**Target State:**
- **~15-18 consolidated subcategories** (~33-44% reduction)

---

## Phase 1: Merge Slideshow/Presentation into Document

### New Subcategories Added from Slideshow/Presentation:

| Subcategory | Rationale for Inclusion in Document |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Decision-making presentation** | Slide decks are documents; content type is defined by purpose, not just format |
| **Educational/training presentation** | Training materials in slide format are instructional documents |
| **Informative presentation** | Information-sharing slide decks are a form of document |
| **Motivational presentation** | Presentation slides are distributable documents |

**Note:** Guide and Tutorial already exist in Document, so no duplication.

---

## Phase 2: Consolidation Rationale & Groupings

After analyzing the 27 subcategories, I've identified **7 logical groups** with redundancies within each:

---

### Group 1: Short Printed Informational Materials (Consolidation Opportunity)

**Current (4 items):**
- Booklet
- Brochure
- Factsheet
- Flyer

**Consolidated into: `Informational Booklet`**

**Rationale:**
- All are **short-form printed materials** (typically 1-8 pages)
- In practice, "booklet" and "brochure" are used interchangeably by users
- "Factsheet" and "flyer" are essentially the same format—single-page information delivery
- The distinctions are **format minutiae**, not meaningful content differences
- Users searching for concise printed information don't benefit from these granular distinctions

**New Definition:** *Short printed materials (1-8 pages) providing concise information, promotional content, or summaries.*

---

### Group 2: Guidance & Reference Materials (Consolidation Opportunity)

**Current (4 items):**
- Handbook
- Manual
- Guide
- Tutorial

**Consolidated into: `Guide/Manual`**

**Rationale:**
- In modern usage, **"handbook" and "manual" are synonymous**
- Both provide comprehensive reference instructions
- "Guide" is slightly broader but functionally overlaps significantly
- "Tutorial" is instructional but the distinction from "guide" is often arbitrary
- From a user perspective: *"I need instructions on how to do something"* — they don't distinguish between these

**Note:** Could also consider keeping "Tutorial" separate if the focus is on step-by-step learning vs. reference.

**Alternative approach:**
- **Guide/Manual** (Handbook + Manual + Guide)
- Keep **Tutorial** separate (instructional, step-by-step)

---

### Group 3: Project & Technical Reports (Major Consolidation)

**Current (6 items):**
- Deliverable report
- Milestone report
- Report/paper
- Review document
- Technical/technology article
- Technical information/specifications card

**Consolidated into: `Technical Report`**

**Rationale:**
- **"Deliverable report"** and **"milestone report"** are project management terminology, not content types
- **"Report/paper"** and **"review document"** are essentially the same—formal technical documents
- **"Technical/technology article"** and **"technical information/specifications card"** are both technical documentation, just different lengths
- Users searching for technical information don't care about whether it was called a "deliverable" or "milestone" in a project
- The distinctions create **fragmentation**—related technical content is scattered across 6 categories

**New Definition:** *Formal technical documentation including project reports, research papers, reviews, and specifications.*

---

### Group 4: Academic Publications (Partial Consolidation)

**Current (5 items):**
- Article in conference proceedings
- Journal article
- Chapter in edited volume
- Thesis
- Book

**Recommendation: KEEP SEPARATE** (with minor note)

**Rationale for NOT consolidating:**
- These are **well-established academic categories** with clear distinctions
- Peer-review status differs (journal articles are peer-reviewed, conference proceedings may vary)
- Academic users specifically search by these types
- "Book" and "Thesis" are distinct in scope, authorship, and purpose

**Note:** Could consider merging "Article in conference proceedings" and "Journal article" into **"Academic Article"**, but this loses important distinction about venue/prestige.

---

### Group 5: Presentation Types (Consolidation Opportunity)

**Current (5 items - 1 from Document, 4 from Slideshow/Presentation):**
- Practice abstract (Document)
- Decision-making presentation (from Slideshow)
- Educational/training presentation (from Slideshow)
- Informative presentation (from Slideshow)
- Motivational presentation (from Slideshow)

**Consolidated into: `Presentation`**

**Rationale:**
- **Purpose-based distinctions** (decision-making, educational, informative, motivational) are too granular
- A single presentation can serve **multiple purposes**
- "Practice abstract" is essentially a short informative presentation about practices
- The **format** (slide deck) is the common factor, not the specific intent
- Users searching for presentations want to find ALL slide-based content, not be filtered by assumed purpose

**New Definition:** *Slide-based presentations for any purpose: informational, educational, decision-making, or motivational.*

---

### Group 6: News & Communication (Consolidation Opportunity)

**Current (3 items):**
- Newsletter
- Press release
- Policy brief

**Consolidated into: `News & Communication`**

**Rationale:**
- All three are **time-sensitive communication documents**
- "Newsletter" (periodic updates), "Press release" (public announcement), and "Policy brief" (concise policy communication) serve similar communication purposes
- From a content organization perspective, users looking for "current updates/announcements" would benefit from a unified category
- The distinctions are **organizational/audience-based**, not content-type based

**Alternative approach:** Keep **Policy brief** separate if policy content is a distinct use case for the platform.

---

### Group 7: Standalone Items (Keep Separate)

**No consolidation needed:**
- **Book** - Major publication type, distinct
- **Thesis** - Academic degree requirement, distinct
- **Chapter in edited volume** - Specific contribution type
- **Article in conference proceedings** - Academic peer-reviewed work
- **Journal article** - Academic peer-reviewed work

---

## Summary of Proposed Consolidations

| Current Subcategories | Consolidated To | Reasoning |
|----------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Booklet, Brochure, Factsheet, Flyer | **Informational Booklet** | All short printed materials; distinctions are arbitrary |
| Handbook, Manual, Guide | **Guide/Manual** | Synonymous terms for reference materials |
| Deliverable report, Milestone report, Report/paper, Review document, Technical article, Tech specs card | **Technical Report** | All formal technical documentation; project terminology shouldn't drive categories |
| Practice abstract, Decision-making presentation, Educational presentation, Informative presentation, Motivational presentation | **Presentation** | Purpose-based distinctions too granular; format unifies them |
| Newsletter, Press release, Policy brief | **News & Communication** | Time-sensitive communication documents |

---

## Final Consolidated Document Subcategories

### Final List (~16 categories):

1. **Article in conference proceedings** *(keep)*
2. **Journal article** *(keep)*
3. **Chapter in edited volume** *(keep)*
4. **Book** *(keep)*
5. **Thesis** *(keep)*
6. **Informational Booklet** *(consolidated: Booklet, Brochure, Factsheet, Flyer)*
7. **Guide/Manual** *(consolidated: Handbook, Manual, Guide)*
8. **Tutorial** *(keep separate - instructional focus)*
9. **Technical Report** *(consolidated: Deliverable, Milestone, Report/paper, Review, Technical article, Tech specs)*
10. **Presentation** *(consolidated: Practice abstract + all presentation types from Slideshow)*
11. **News & Communication** *(consolidated: Newsletter, Press release, Policy brief)*

**Total: 11 consolidated subcategories** (down from 27 = **59% reduction**)

## Rationale Summary Table

| Merge Group | Items Merged | New Name | Primary Reason |
|-------------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Booklet, Brochure, Factsheet, Flyer | Informational Booklet | All short printed info materials; format distinctions arbitrary |
| 2 | Handbook, Manual, Guide | Guide/Manual | Terms are synonymous in practice |
| 3 | Deliverable report, Milestone report, Report/paper, Review document, Technical article, Tech specs | Technical Report | Project terminology fragments technical content |
| 4 | Practice abstract, Decision-making, Educational, Informative, Motivational presentations | Presentation | Purpose distinctions too granular; format unifies |
| 5 | Newsletter, Press release, Policy brief | News & Communication | All time-sensitive communication documents |

## Benefits of This Consolidation

1. **Removes arbitrary format distinctions** (booklet vs. brochure vs. flyer)
2. **Eliminates project management jargon** from categories (deliverable, milestone)
3. **Unifies presentation content** under Document where it belongs
4. **Improves discoverability** - fewer, more meaningful categories
5. **Reduces user confusion** - no need to choose between synonymous terms
6. **59% reduction** in subcategory count (27 → 11)
